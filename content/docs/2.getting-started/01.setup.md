description: Getting started with Nuxt Starter
---

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

## Clone the repository

The repository is publicly available on GitHub. You can clone it and start to use it.

git clone https://github.com/kmilogp8496/nuxt-starter.git
```

## Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Run the application

## Tasks resolution

All the tasks are available in the [roadmap](./roadmap.md) page. Since there is no project management tool, you can **create a new issue** and assign it to yourself. Remember to tag the issue with `wip` and `feature` so it can be found by others.

Better ways will arrive soon for managing the tasks. Stay tuned!

## Nuxt UI Pro

The application uses [Nuxt UI Pro](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro) for the UI. You can use the project in your development environment without the need of a license. In case you want to use it in production, you can buy a license [here](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/pricing) and use it in your project. Give it a try and if you like it, please support the Nuxt OSS development by buying a license.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project, you can create a new issue or a Pull Request.
